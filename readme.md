# Terminal Aliases

This single `.aliases` file contains several helpful shell functions and aliases for both Mac OS X and Linux environments.

For the sake of simplicity, I am trying to only include the most useful functions I've found while being a developer.

### Install

Simply checkout this project into your home directory (or download the `.aliases` file). Include this file in your bash/zsh/dash/etc.. config (it should be named `~/.bashrc` if you haven't installed any custom shells) by adding the following line:

    # Load my aliases
    source $HOME/.aliases
